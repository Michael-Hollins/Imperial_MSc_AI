\chapter{Introduction}

Almost every country in the world has committed to the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty that aims to limit the global temperature increase above pre-industrial levels to 1.5 degrees Celsius: to achieve this, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must peak before 2025 and decline 43\% by 2030 \cite{unfcc2024}. Therefore, at the time of writing, we should have reached peak GHG emissions and must expect steep reductions to follow, especially in carbon dioxide which comprises most of the GHG mix \cite{Ritchie2023}. 
\\\\
For these ambitious targets to be achieved, firms must play a part to reduce their carbon emissions. As ``what gets measured, gets managed'', a necessary first step is for firms to account and report their GHG emissions . Accurate GHG emissions data is vital for meeting regulatory obligations, establishing a well-functioning emissions trading market, allowing investors to hedge their transition risk and follow their preferences, and helping firms improve their efficiency by identifying opportunities for reducing waste. 
\\\\
Recognising the need for a common framework across jurisdictions, an alliance of businesses, governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and others founded the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative to develop internationally accepted GHG accounting and reporting standards for business \cite{ghgprotocol2004}. This Protocol divides emissions into three categories: Scope 1 (S1) encompasses a firm's direct emissions; Scope 2 (S2) are GHG emissions from purchased energy; and Scope 3 (S3) are all other indirect emissions from the value chain. 
\\\\
With the GHG Protocol steadily being adopted, over time the availability and quality of GHG emissions data has improved significantly. Nevertheless, with the standards not yet mandatory or uniformly applied in every jurisdiction, the coverage remains uneven \cite{ManGroup2022}. This raises the problem of how to estimate emissions when the data are missing. Refinitiv Eikon, the industrial partner in this project, fills the gaps using a sector median. The goal for this project is to explore what quantitative techniques can be used to improve on this baseline for estimating GHG emissions data; the priority is estimating S1 data and progressing to the other scopes if time allows.

\chapter{Background}\label{sec:ChapterBackground}

This chapter reviews some basic domain knowledge to help place the estimation and forecasting techniques in our applied context. We begin with the historical and policy background in Sections \ref{sec:HistoricalContext} and \ref{sec:PolicyContext} respectively. This serves as a springboard to review the GHG Protocol in detail in Section \ref{sec:Scope3Reporting}, which is crucial for developing an understanding of the data-generating process. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:Scope3Modelling} we conclude by reviewing how data coverage and quality has evolved. 

\section{Historical context}\label{sec:HistoricalContext}
Beginning in the 1800s, naturalists were puzzled to find signs of glacial activity in places too warm for ice sheets to form \cite{young1995}. Then, as the century progressed, some scientists discovered that certain gases such as carbon dioxide caused a so-called ``greenhouse effect'' in their experiments \cite{Ekholm1901}; therefore, they hypothesised that these greenhouse gases (GHGs) might affect the planet's temperature through trapping heat in the atmosphere \cite{Arrhenius1896}. Accordingly, it was plausible that past climates could have been very different from our own \cite{foote1856}. 
\\\\
Consistent with this theory, during the twentieth century scientists observed both rising global surface temperatures and steep increases in concentrations of GHGs \cite{Sawyer1972}. Thus, today's mainstream scientific consensus is that the earth's recent climate change is mostly driven by human activity: as economic development has increased the combustion of fossil fuels, this has raised GHG levels in the atmosphere resulting in higher global temperatures \cite{IPCC2021, RS2020}. 

Accompanying the growing weight of scientific evidence was political conviction that something must be done. Consequently, landmark international treaties such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol \cite{UN1997} and the 2015 Paris Agreement \cite{UNFCCC2020} legally mandated that countries reduce their GHG emissions. Adding to the scientific and political momentum around climate change, growing public concern for the environment further catalysed domestic support for national targets such as Net Zero \cite{Poortinga2023}.

They are measured in billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalents over a 100-year timescale.}

\end{figure}

\section{Policy context}\label{sec:PolicyContext}
To meet GHG reduction targets, emissions must be both accurately and consistently measured, and so policy makers came together to build an international standard for corporate GHG accounting and reporting. Accordingly, in 1998 they launched the \href{https://ghgprotocol.org/about-us}{GHG Protocol Initiative} with the mission to develop GHG reporting standards for businesses \cite{ghgprotocol2004}. Since then, the GHG Protocol has been incorporated into global reporting standards including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 305, \cite{gri2016}), the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS S2, \cite{ifrs2023}) and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD, \cite{tcfd2021}).
\\\\
Simply put, the GHG Protocol provides a framework for firms to account for their GHG emissions, which are first divided into \textit{direct} and \textit{indirect}. Direct emissions come from sources that are owned or controlled by the company. On the other hand, while indirect emissions are a consequence of activities of the company, they occur at sources owned or controlled outside the company. 
\\\\
To help delineate this further, three ``scopes'' are defined for GHG accounting and reporting purposes. First,  scope 1 (S1) emissions are direct emissions from sources which are owned or controlled by the company. Second, scope 2 (S2) emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of energy that is purchased, such as from electricity, steam, heat and cooling. Finally, scope 3 (S3) comprises all other indirect emissions that occur in the company's value chain. Together, these scopes encompass the total emissions footprint of a company as summarised in Figure \ref{fig:Scope3Diagram} below.

\end{figure}

In accordance with the Protocol, many jurisdictions require (or will soon require) S1 and S2 disclosures for publicly listed firms, including in the EU \cite{eu20232772}, the US \cite{sec2024}, the UK \cite{ukleg2013} and Japan \cite{fsa2022}. Furthermore, although S3 reporting is currently optional in most of these key financial markets, the regulatory landscape is shifting away from voluntary efforts and towards mandatory S3 disclosures \cite{ftserussell2024}. 
\\ \\
To illustrate these developments, we trace how reporting requirements in the UK, one of the most progressive jurisdictions in climate reporting, have picked up over time. Beginning in 2013, listed companies were required to report their S1 and S2 emissions \cite{ukleg2013}. To bring in additional reporting requirements for listed companies, in 2018 the UK introduced the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) regime. More significantly, this legislation also brought in new requirements for large unquoted companies and limited liability partnerships to report their S1 and S2 emissions. In addition, it strongly encouraged S3 reporting from all companies, signalling the intended direction of travel. Accordingly, the UK Government's stated ambition is to introduce mandatory S3 reporting across the entire economy by 2025 in line with the recommendations of the TCFD \cite{ukgov2020}. 
\\ \\
\section{Scope 3 reporting} \label{sec:Scope3Reporting}
Having set out the origins and development of GHG emission targets, it remains to consider what is required for a firm to comply with the GHG Protocol \textit{Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard} \cite{ghgscope32013}. A detailed understanding of this process will help illuminate the issues with data quality which are covered in Section \ref{sec:Scope3Challenges}.
\\ \\
After the firm has divided its GHG emissions into direct and indirect, the first task is to \textbf{set the Scope 3 boundary}; in short, this means accounting for all Scope 3 emissions in the value chain and to disclose and justify any exclusions. This includes the gases contained in the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (C0\textsubscript{2}), methane (CH\textsubscript{4}), nitrous oxide (N\textsubscript{2}0), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and lastly sulphur hexafluoride (SF\textsubscript{6}). Furthermore, the company is required to account for these emissions in their respective Scope 3 categories as listed in Table \ref{tab:Scope3Categories}.

\end{table}

These distinct categories are designed to help firms organise, understand and report on the diversity of Scope 3 activities throughout their value chain. However, while aiming for completeness, it is clear that in some cases, accounting for all of these emissions will not be feasible.  Therefore, the GHG Protocol concedes that while some omissions are permitted, ``Companies should ensure that the scope 3 inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the company, and serves the decision-making needs of users, both internal and external to the company. In particular, companies should not exclude any activity that is expected to contribute significantly to the company's total scope 3 emissions'' (\cite{ghgscope32013}, p.60).  
\\ \\
After identifying the most likely sources of significant emissions in the value chain, the firm must then \textbf{collect data} for quantifying emissions in the Scope 3 categories. There are two main methods to do this. First, where the firm has access to direct emissions data, then they can simply use the direct measurement. In practice, the second method of calculation is much more common, in which the firm uses activity data and emission factors to estimate emissions. In any case, the actual or estimated emissions data is then converted into a carbon dioxide equivalent (C0\textsubscript{2}e) so that Scope 3 emissions can be aggregated and compared regardless of GHG type. If any data remains missing, firms may use proxy data to fill gaps. 
\\ \\
Using this data, the firm must \textbf{estimate} their Scope 3 emissions for each category. Importantly, companies may use a combination of calculation methods both within and across categories. There are three calculation methods outlined in the Scope 3 Technical Guidance and recognised by the literature \cite{ghgscope32013, GoldhammerEtAl2017}. First, there is a process analysis (PA) approach which is bottom-up: it uses primary and secondary production process data and its associated carbon emissions. This has a high level of specificity and focus but may be costly or impossible data to collect. Second, there is input-output analysis (IOA) which is top-down: it uses the input-output tables in the national accounts to allocate the carbon emissions of the economy to smaller units on a sectoral basis. This approach is simple to apply but by providing only averages in a population, it lacks specificity, nuance, and it is difficult to show the results of reduction efforts. Third, there are hybrid approaches which combine PA and IOA which try to combine the strengths of both: under this approach, companies usually begin bottom-up and then fill any remaining gaps top-down \cite{Crawford2008}. 
\\ \\
Finally, to comply with the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard \cite{ghgscope32013}, the firm must \textbf{report} their Scope 3 emissions with the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Total scope emissions reported separately by each Scope 3 category;
	\item For each Scope 3 category, total GHG emissions reported in metric tons of C0\textsubscript{2} equivalent, excluding biogenic C0\textsubscript{2} emissions and independent of any GHG trades, such as purchases, sales, or transfers of offsets or allowances;
	\item A list of Scope 3 categories and activities included in the inventory;
	\item A list of Scope 3 categories or activities excluded from the inventory, and with justification for their exclusion;
	\item Once a base year has been established: the year chosen as the Scope 3 base year; the rationale for choosing the base year; the base year's recalculation policy; Scope 3 emissions by category in the base year, consistent with the base year emissions recalculation policy; and appropriate context for any significant emissions changes that triggered base year emissions recalculations;
	\item For each Scope 3 category, any biogenic C0\textsubscript{2} emissions reported separately; 
	\item For each Scope 3 category, a description of the various types and sources of data, including activity data, emission factors and global warming potential (GWP) values, used to calculate emissions, and a description of the data quality of reported emissions data;
	\item For each Scope 3 category, a description of the methodologies, the allocation methods, and assumptions used to calculate Scope 3 emissions;
	\item For each Scope 3 category, the percentage of emissions calculated using data obtained from suppliers or other value chain partners.
\end{itemize}
These reporting requirements are clearly not trivial; such is their nature and extent that some have concluded that they are practically unworkable in their current form \cite{patchell2018}. The next Section explores the common problems with Scope 3 data that follow from these disclosures.

\section{Scope 3 data challenges}\label{sec:Scope3Challenges}

Early studies exploring the nascent Scope 3 assessments found that the data were largely incomplete and lacking rigour \cite{DownieStubbs2013}. Moreover, even after a decade, a report by FTSE-Russell concluded that the data were still characterised by large gaps and poor quality \cite{ftserussell2024}. This suggests that something in the data generating process (as outlined above in Section \ref{sec:Scope3Reporting}) could be driving these inadequate outcomes. This Section describes the main shortcomings of Scope 3 data. Beginning with a review of challenges inherent in the data generating process, we subsequently highlight the problems this causes for analysis. 

\subsection{Issues with the data generating process}\label{sec:DataGenIssues}

Klaaßen and Stoll \cite{klassenstoll2021} identify three causes of error in firms' GHG emissions data: reporting inconsistency, boundary incompleteness and activity exclusion. 

\subsubsection{Reporting inconsistency}

Firms may disclose their Scope 3 GHG emissions through corporate channels, such as annual reports, or to third parties such as the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). However, there is no need for these disclosures to be consistent with each other as they are written for different purposes and audiences. Accordingly, in line with the expectations of stakeholder theory, studies have found that on average, GHG emissions disclosed in corporate reports are lower than those reported to the CDP \cite{depoers2016, klassenstoll2021}. As corporate reports are less prescriptive than the CDP questionnaire, it appears that firms use them to paint a better picture of their GHG emissions to the wider public. Notwithstanding this, different figures do not imply fraudulent disclosure: it may simply reflect the choice of valid but different methodologies \cite{depoers2016}. In any case, the upshot is that even for a given firm in a given year which self-reports, there is potentially no consistent source of ground truth. 

\subsubsection{Boundary incompleteness}

For the 15 categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions, the GHG Protocol recommends a minimum boundary of what to include. Therefore, for each category, companies are encouraged to choose the most appropriate calculation method depending on data quality and quantity. These calculation methods are either top-down (input-output based), bottom-up (processed based), or a hybrid of the two which begins bottom-up and then fills in the gaps top-down. Furthermore, for the most material categories, firms are encouraged to use primary data, i.e. data sourced directly from other firms. However, there is often limited data transparency across the value chain and so this option is commonly unavailable. Where secondary data such as industry reports and production volumes is also missing, boundary incompleteness follows. Some scholars such as Patchell \cite{patchell2018} argue that this is an intractable problem due to the complexity of global supply chains and the prohibitive costs involved. This might explain why despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) previously intending to introduce compulsory Scope 3 disclosures, a move that some argued was a vital step for improving coverage \cite{lgim2023}, it has instead decided against this course of action following consultations \cite{sec2024}.

\subsubsection{Activity exclusion}

Finally, even when firms report their Scope 3 emissions, they may choose to omit certain relevant categories entirely. Despite the encouragements of standard setters to report Scope 3 emissions that are considered `material' (ISSB) \cite{ifrs2023}, `appropriate' (TCFD) \cite{tcfd2021}, or `significant' (GRI) \cite{gri2016},  firms often report what is easier to measure (e.g. business travel) rather than what is important to their carbon footprint. For example, in their 2022 report, CDP found that only 36\% of reporting firms disclosed their Purchased Goods and Services (Category 1) emissions, which are relevant for almost every sector \cite{cdp2022}. As this remains a persistent problem, FTSE Russell \cite{ftserussell2024} has recommended that companies begin by reporting the two most material categories for their sector, which on average should encompass over 80\% of their total Scope 3 emissions. 

\subsection{Consequential problems for data analysis}

Together, the three problems in Section \ref{sec:DataGenIssues} prove a major hindrance to analysis. 
\subsubsection{Missing data}
The main reason for the paucity of data comes from the nature of Scope 3 emissions: in contrast to Scopes 1 and 2, they are by construction emissions in the value chain beyond the firm's direct control or ownership and thereby are much more challenging for a firm to collect. Ideally firms would share data across the value chain, however there remain significant barriers to doing this, including legal and regulatory challenges, interoperability and data privacy \cite{StenzelWaichman2023}. 

Accordingly, across various datasets, Scope 3 coverage typically exists for only around half of firms.\footnote{45\% of FTSE All-World constituents report Scope 3 data as of 2021 \cite{ftserussell2024}. For firms reporting to the CDP, 41\% of disclosed emissions for one or more Scope 3 category in 2022 \cite{cdp2023}. Bloomberg and Refinitiv Eikon appear to have slightly higher proportions \cite{Nguyenetal2023}.} Furthermore, as reporting remains voluntary and the propensity to report depends on firms' characteristics such as size, sector, and reporting jurisdiction, the missing data should be assumed to be `missing not at random' (MNAR). However, current estimation models used by data providers often do not take this uncertainty into account, leading to misleading prediction intervals and inaccurate predictions \cite{olesiewicz2021}. In this way, missing data is closely related to biased data, the second problem in analysis. 

\subsubsection{Biased data}
Whereas a firm which is non-reporting is conspicuous by its absence, a more subtle problem is when a firm under-reports due to boundary incompleteness and activity exclusion. Without close scrutiny of a firm's methodology, the researcher risks assuming that the reported total Scope 3 emissions is an accurate reflection of the firm's carbon footprint, rather than a reflection of what they choose to measure and report. This problem also further degrades the data generating process; as most firms which self-report under-report their emissions, firms which benchmark themselves to peer averages also under-report as a result \cite{Hoepner2021}. Both problems of missing data (non-reporting) and biased data (under-reporting) are illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:Scope3Coverage}, which shows that most firms don't report their Scope 3 data (one minus the orange line), and for those that do, they mostly report immaterial figures (gap between orange and green line).

		\fnote{Source: FTSE-Russell \cite{ftserussell2024}, reporting entities are from the FTSE All-World constituents that disclose Scope 3 emissions}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Volatile data}
The relative immaturity of Scope 3 reporting is reflected in the high volatility of the data (see Figure \ref{fig:Scope3Volatility}). As of 2021, over half of the disclosed values vary by over 20\% year-on-year, and over a third vary by at least 50\%. Although this is something that could improve over time as reporting practices evolve, any forecasting exercise using this past data will likely be struggle with robustness. In addition, it appears that actually the data is becoming more volatile over time. Moreover, parameter estimates are unlikely to be statistically significant due to the wide confidence intervals derived from the noisy data. 

\subsubsection{Lack of consistency and comparability}
Besides errors, revisions, and omissions that may arise from the complex task of reporting Scope 3 emissions, there are other reasons why the data may not be comparable across firms or data sources. First, despite what may appear a tightly prescriptive approach in Section \ref{sec:Scope3Reporting}, the GHG Protocol is flexible enough to provide a wide latitude in accounting and reporting methodologies. Firms must make a number of choices including their organisational boundaries, which categories to report, the calculation approach for each category, data sources, how to allocate emissions, whether to report optional extras above the minimum boundaries etc. As long as these choices can be justified according to the five accounting principles (relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency, accuracy) then they are said to conform to Scope 3 reporting standards \cite{ghgscope32013}. This methodological flexibility opens the possibility for large heterogeneity in firms' accounting and reporting their Scope 3 emissions: accordingly, firms may be consistent with respect to themselves, but aggregating them into a portfolio risks comparing apples and oranges (see Box 2 in \cite{ftserussell2024} for an illustration). 
\\ \\
Second, the GHG Protocol and Scope 3 Guidance is often complimented with standard setters' frameworks and legal rules. While these may intend to be aligned to the GHG, invariably they introduce particular interpretations and requirements which their signatories are expected to adopt. This could lead to additional inconsistencies, especially between sectors which may each follow their own industry-specific practices. For example, many financial institutions have adopted the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) in an attempt to enhance reporting quality for Category 15 of Scope 3 emissions \cite{PCAF2022}. However, as pointed out by Tang et al. \cite{Tang2023}, the practical considerations of GHG estimation means that PCAF's framework may provide contradictory guidance, leading to non-standardisation, inaccuracy and inconsistency. 
\\ \\
When researchers wish to compare the GHG emissions of many firms, or investors want to evaluate the transition risk of their portfolio, they frequently turn to third party data providers such as Bloomberg, CDP, ISS-Ethix, MSCI, Sustainalytics, Thomas Reuters, and Trucost.  The main issue is that data often has to be estimated to fill in the gaps, and unfortunately data providers each use their own methodologies of varying transparency. These different approaches can compound the inconsistency across the data and make it challenging for people to know what the ``real'' Scope 3 emissions are of a collection of firms. For example, both Busch et al. \cite{Busch2022} and Kalesnik et al. \cite{KalesnikVitali2022}  found that the choice of a particular data provider may significantly affect empirical results and that third-party estimated data is less consistent as compared to data stemming directly from corporate reports. Concerningly, Busch et al. also found that third-party estimated data inconsistency is increasing over time.  However, even for values reported by firms, surprisingly Nguyen et al. \cite{Nguyenetal2023} found that divergence still exists between third-party datasets, having only 68\% identical data points between Bloomberg and Refinitiv Eikon. 

\section{Estimating GHG emissions}\label{sec:Scope3Modelling}
There are two key takeaways from the literature estimating GHG emissions. First, very few papers attempt to estimate Scope 3 emissions, and more generally there are relatively few quantitative papers on Scope 3 emissions due to data quality and availability limitations \cite{Hettler2024}. Second, state-of-the-art techniques are found to deliver only marginal improvements versus relatively simple approaches \cite{Nguyenetal2023, FTSERussell2022, olesiewicz2021}. 
\\ \\
There is no industry consensus on what is the best approach for estimating GHG emissions \cite{FTSERussell2022}. Consequently, a common tactic is to try a battery of methods rather than favour a single methodology. We briefly recap the most common approaches below.

\subsection{Input-output tables}

\subsection{Sector averages}

The simplest approach to estimating Scope 3 data is to fill missing values with the sector median. This has the advantages of being easy to implement and interpret, as well as the ability to adjust granularity based on further groupings such as subsectors and regions. The obvious drawback is that it ignores specific business models and other company information that may be relevant. 
\\ \\
Despite its simplicity, when compared to other estimation techniques, this approach performs relatively well. Nguyen et al. \cite{Nguyenetal2023} find that state-of-the-art machine learning techniques only provide marginal improvements on using sector medians. In addition, FTSE-Russell \cite{FTSERussell2022} find that sophisticated models only provide marginal improvements versus taking a simple sector median to predict GHG emissions. 

\subsection{Regression}

Regression methods aim to model the linear relationships between variables. As with the sector median, Nguyen et al. \cite{Nguyenetal2023} report that their baseline ``naive'' (i.e. using just revenue and employees variables) regression model holds up well against most of the state-of-the-art techniques including machine learning methods. Again, this underlines that simple models perform surprisingly well in a Scope 3 setting. However, this likely represents the poor quality of Scope 3 data which inhibits more sophisticated approaches from working, rather than any particular merit to these simple techniques.  
\\ \\
Other papers use regression for estimating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions: Scope 3 is explicitly ruled out due to data quality concerns \cite{KalesnikVitali2022, GoldhammerEtAl2017}. In this context, Kalesnik and Vitali show that GHG emissions are highly persistent and so a simple autoregressive model can estimate very accurately this year's emissions \cite{KalesnikVitali2022}. Moreover, company characteristics also do a good job at predicting GHG emissions; ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation can capture over 80\% of the variation in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions \cite{GoldhammerEtAl2017, KalesnikVitali2022}. 
\\ \\
With respectable performance of regression in a Scopes 1 and 2 context, it may be hoped that regression could work in a Scope 3 setting too. Unfortunately, \cite{ManGroup2022} found that a regression of Scope 1 and 2 emissions on Scope 3 emissions yields very little explanatory power, implying that these results are unlikely to carry over. This also makes sense from a GHG Protocol point of view: the motivation behind creating Scope 3 was to capture something largely orthogonal to the company's direct emissions and energy consumption. 
\\ \\
Another key drawback for this more traditional statistical approach is that the estimates rely on assumptions that, if not met, will fail to provide the best, linear, and unbiased estimators. Especially important in the context of Scope 3, \cite{olesiewicz2021} show that if the data is MNAR then the OLS estimates will be biased.
