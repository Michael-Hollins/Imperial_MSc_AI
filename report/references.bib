  abstract = {<p>Achieving ambitious carbon reduction targets requires transformative change to society, with behaviour change playing an important role. Climate change mitigation (‘net zero’) policies are needed to accelerate and support such behaviour change. This study examined factors and framing effects in public support for net zero policies in the United Kingdom (UK), making use of a large probability sample (n<sub>total</sub> = 5,665) survey conducted in August 2021. It found that net zero policies are widely supported, with only taxes on red meat and dairy products being supported by less than half of the UK public. Climate worry and perceived fairness were the strongest and most consistent predictors of policy support for net zero policies. The results further suggest that support for net zero policies can be increased by emphasising the co-benefits of the policies, in particular where they are beneficial for health. However, the framing effects were very small. In contrast, public support for net zero policies is lower when potential lifestyle and financial costs are mentioned. This suggests that perceived fairness of the distribution of costs and lifestyle implications of policies are crucial for building and maintaining support for net zero.</p>},

  abstract = {The GHG Protocol has become the standard for corporate reporting of greenhouse gases, adopted by governments for regulations, NGOs for accountability and corporations for compliance. The GHG Protocol's scope 1 and 2 have largely succeeded in gaining compliance from large firms to report their internal GHG emissions and those from electricity purchases. Achieving Scope 3's intent of a full audit of value chain emissions GHG, however, is a much more complicated affair and according to the CDP, scope 3 is much less successful. This lack of success challenges the premise and purpose of the standard, especially, the expectation that the power of MNCs can be used to leverage reporting and reductions through the value chain. This paper constructs a heuristic framework to explain why success has been limited. The paper discusses six interdependent factors that inhibit scope 3's ambition of promoting the measurement and management of GHG emissions throughout the value chain. These factors are transaction costs, power, responsibility allocation, uncertainty, location contingency and production costs. The impact of these factors on likelihood of compliance to the scope 3 are revealed by an examination of what the sustainable supply chain management, the supply chain management and other literature tell us about value chain interactions on environmental performance. The weight of these factors cast doubt on scope 3's ambition to compel firms to report a full audit of their scope 3 emissions. Moreover, the pursuit of that ambition diverts corporate efforts from more efficient and effective environmental efforts. The paper concludes with a discussion of options for harnessing the power of the lifecycle approach to reforming the value chain.},

  abstract  = {Investors’ sophistication on climate risk is increasing and as part of this they require high-quality and comprehensive Scope 3 emissions data. Accordingly, we investigate Scope 3 emissions data divergence (across different providers), composition (which Scope 3 categories are reported) and whether machine-learning models can be used to predict Scope 3 emissions for non-reporting firms. We find considerable divergence in the aggregated Scope 3 emissions values from three of the largest data providers (Bloomberg, Refinitiv Eikon, and ISS). The divergence is largest for ISS, as it replaces reported Scope 3 emissions with estimates from its economic input-output and life cycle assessment modelling. With respect to the composition of Scope 3 emissions, firms generally report incomplete composition, yet they are reporting more categories over time. There is a persistent contrast between relevance and completeness in the composition of Scope 3 emissions across sectors, with low materiality categories such as travel emissions being reported more frequently than typically high materiality ones, such as the use of products and processing of sold products. Finally, machine learning algorithms can improve the prediction accuracy of the aggregated Scope 3 emissions by up to 6\% and up to 25\% when each category is estimated individually and aggregated into total Scope 3 emissions. However, absolute prediction performance is low even with the best models, with the accuracy of estimates primarily limited by low observations in specific Scope 3 categories. We conclude that investors should be cognizant of Scope 3 emissions data divergence, incomplete reporting of Scope 3 categories, and that predictions for non-reporting firms have high absolute errors even when using machine learning models. For both reported and estimated data, caveat emptor applies.},

This decarbonization challenge has, inter alia, increased the political and societal pressure on companies to disclose their carbon footprints. As a response, numerous companies announced roadmaps to become carbon neutral or even negative. The first step on the journey towards carbon neutrality, however, is to quantify corporate emissions accurately. Current carbon accounting and reporting practices remain unsystematic and not comparable, particularly for emissions along the value chain (so-called scope 3). Here we present a framework to harmonize scope 3 emissions by accounting for reporting inconsistency, boundary incompleteness, and activity exclusion. In a case study of the tech sector, we find that corporate reports omit half of the total emissions. The framework we present may help companies, investors, and policy makers to identify and close the gaps in corporate carbon footprints.},

In this paper, we investigate the consistency of the GHG information voluntarily disclosed by French listed firms through two different communication channels: corporate reports (CR) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). More precisely, we contrast the amounts of GHG emissions reported and the methodological explanations provided (named ‘traceability’) in each channel. Consistent with a stakeholder theory perspective, we find that GHG amounts are significantly lower in the CR than in the CDP. We also find that firms increase the CR figures’ traceability when there is a discrepancy between disclosures in the two channels. We suggest that the aim of this greater traceability is to enhance information credibility across the different channels used.},

  abstract = {Abstract Corporate carbon performance (CCP) has become a central topic in political, financial, and academic domains. At the same time, several characteristics of CCP data, including comparability and consistency, remain unresolved. The literature has extensively covered issues regarding the comparability of CCP data from a firm-internal perspective. However, it has not yet examined the consistency of CCP data between third-party data providers. This article investigates the degree of CCP data consistency between third-party providers according to three dimensions: scope (i.e., direct and indirect emissions), scheme (i.e., mandatory and voluntary reporting schemes), and source (i.e., data stemming from corporate reports and from third-party estimation methods). The results reveal that data on direct emissions are more consistent than data on indirect emissions, and they are especially inconsistent for Scope 3. Second, mandatory and voluntary reporting schemes do not substantially improve the consistency of CCP data, which is surprising. Third, third-party estimations are less consistent as compared to data stemming directly from corporate reports; however, the combination of Scopes 1 and 2 third-party estimated data raises consistency levels. On the basis of these results, we conclude the following key implications: academic researchers must be mindful of the consistency of CCP data, because it can significantly affect empirical results, corporate management should avoid situations where different CCP data are communicated externally, investors should engage firms to follow a standardized approach, data providers should increase the transparency about their estimation methods, and policy makers need to be aware of the importance of a sound and standardized methodology to determine CCP.},

  abstract = {Summary Corporate carbon footprints (CCFs) are a core tool in greenhouse gas emissions reporting. Established approaches for CCF calculation are based on an internal perspective that requires detailed corporate information. However, many firms do not publish information about their emissions. We seek to close this data gap by estimating scope 1 and 2 CCFs from an external perspective. The study uses a regression analysis approach, using actual firm-internally computed CCFs to assess their degree of predictability from the outside. Data were collected from 93 European companies belonging to the chemicals, construction and engineering, and industrial machinery sectors. As predictors, we use five measures that are computed with publicly available corporate data: firm size; level of vertical integration; capital intensity; centrality of production; and carbon intensity of the national energy mix. The analysis shows that significant explanatory power for the CCF can be observed for size, capital intensity, and centrality of production. The best estimation results are achieved when data from different sectors are integrated into a comprehensive all-sector model, while accounting for sector-specific emission intensities by means of dummy variables. With an adjusted R² value of 0.817, the proposed procedure estimates CCFs in an accurate, yet also efficient, manner. Moreover, the study enhances trust in the current CCF calculation practices by showing that their results are plausible from a third-party perspective.},

  abstract = {The life-cycle inventory analysis step of a life-cycle assessment (LCA) may currently suffer from several limitations, mainly concerned with the use of incomplete and unreliable data sources and methods of assessment. Many past LCA studies have used traditional inventory analysis methods, namely process analysis and input–output analysis. More recently, hybrid inventory analysis methods have been developed, combining these two traditional methods in an attempt to minimise their limitations. In light of recent improvements, these hybrid methods need to be compared and validated, as these too have been considered to have several limitations. This paper evaluates a recently developed hybrid inventory analysis method which aims to improve the limitations of previous methods. It was found that the truncation associated with process analysis can be up to 87\%, reflecting the considerable shortcomings in the quantity of process data currently available. Capital inputs were found to account for up to 22\% of the total inputs to a particular product. These findings suggest that current best-practice methods are sufficiently accurate for most typical applications, but this is heavily dependant upon data quality and availability. The use of input–output data assists in improving the system boundary completeness of life-cycle inventories. However, the use of input–output analysis alone does not always provide an accurate model for replacing process data. Further improvements in the quantity of process data currently available are needed to increase the reliability of life-cycle inventories.},
